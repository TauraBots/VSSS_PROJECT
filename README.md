**Very Small Size Soccer (VSSS)** is a robotics project that involves creating teams of autonomous robots capable of playing soccer on a small-sized field. This project is often used in robotics competitions and as an educational tool for teaching artificial intelligence, computer vision, control, and embedded systems.

## Overview

The VSSS project consists of developing a team of robots that can communicate, make decisions, and play soccer autonomously. The system usually includes:

- **Mobile Robots**: Small robots equipped with motors, sensors, and microcontrollers.
- **Computer Vision**: A camera system that captures the field and tracks the position of the robots and the ball.
- **Strategy and Control**: Decision algorithms that control the behavior of the robots during the game. - **Communication**: A communication system between the robots and the central computer.

## Requirements

To execute this project, you will need the following components:

- **Hardware**:
  - Mobile robots (with motors, sensors and microcontrollers).
  - Cameras for computer vision.
  - Computer for image processing and strategy.
  - Ball and playing field.

- **Software**:
  - Development environment (e.g. ROS, Python, C++).
  - Computer vision libraries (e.g. OpenCV).
  - Firmware for the robots (e.g. Arduino, ESP32).
